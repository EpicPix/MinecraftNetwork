# MinecraftNetwork

A open source Minecraft Network built on Bukkit and BungeeCord (Very beta)

# Requirements

You will require

 - Java 8 JDK
 - An IDE to compile everything
 - A MongoDB host that supports Change Streams (MongoDB Atlas will work fine)
 - A server to host the server on (Local machine would work fine)

**While compiling you will need to change Common/src/secrets.json to contain the secrets of your mongodb server (DO NOT LEAK/SHARE THE FILE WITH ANYONE)**
