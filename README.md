# MinecraftNetwork

A open source Minecraft Network Project using BungeeCord and Spigot with Node.js to create a ServerManager (Alpha)

While compiling you will need to change [secrets.json](Common/src/secrets.json) to contain the secrets of the ServerManager

A ServerManager is a Server which will control all settings, player data, languages, servers. Without it the project won't run.

# Requirements

You will require

 - Java 16 Java Development Kit
 - A server to host the server on (localhost would work)
 - Node.js hosting

More data will be added later
