# MinecraftNetwork

A open source Minecraft Network built on Spigot and BungeeCord (Very beta)

*While compiling you will need to change ~~ServerController/secrets.js~~ and Common/src/secrets.json to contain the secrets of your mongodb server, **do not share any secrets.json for security reasons***

# Requirements

You will require

 - Java 16 JDK
 - An IDE to compile everything
 - ~~A MongoDB host that supports Change Streams (MongoDB Atlas will work~~ fine)
 - A server to host the server on (Local machine would work fine)
 - Node.js

More data will be added later

MongoDB will not be used in future commits
